# cors demo

Here we demonstrate an implementation of [cross-origin resource sharing](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-origin_resource_sharing).

In order to fully demonstrate this feature, we must start two running instances of this application on ports 8080 and 8081. A static
page with embedded javascript is served from http://localhost:8080/js, and it consumes an SSE EventSource found at http://localhost:8081/.

1. Start two instances on different ports: `lein run 8080` and `lein run 8081`
1. Open the Javascript console, as all output from the sample will be
   displayed there.
1. Visit [localhost:8080/js](http://localhost:8080/js) to load the
   event consumer, and watch the JavaScript console. The inline JavaScript returned
   will attempt to access a service on port 8081, a different origin. If allowed,
   the event source passes back an event containing the thread id, which is consumed
   and displayed in the console.

In `src/cors/service.clj`, you will find a definition of `cors-interceptor` that adds CORS headers
when the origin matches the authorized origin.

For more detailed information, please consult the `NOTES.md` document alongside this README.

## Thanks

This samples uses the `EventSource` polyfill from [Yaffle/EventSource](https://github.com/Yaffle/EventSource).

## Configuration

To configure logging see config/logback.xml. By default, the app logs to stdout and logs/.
To learn more about configuring Logback, read its [documentation](http://logback.qos.ch/documentation.html).
