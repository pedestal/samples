# helloworld-app

You may start the application by running the following commands:

```
$ lein repl
(start)
```

Once it is started, browse to [http://localhost:3000/helloworld-app-dev.html](http://localhost:3000/helloworld-app-dev.html).

This app is structured differently than most pedestal-app applications in that behavior, rendering,
and start are all collapsed into start. This was done just to demonstrate a more compact
application.
